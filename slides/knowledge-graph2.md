Note:

The other day, I was hungry, so I searched for chocolate chip cookies and, right before I got to the results, I got this nice box telling me how to make cookies.

The cool thing? That's from Betty Crocker's site, which is only the #2 result.

The sidebar also has all sorts of information about chocolate chip cookies, pulled from Wikipedia and the USDA.
