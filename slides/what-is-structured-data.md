##  What is structured data?

* Standards to help computers understand our content. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* Content is for humans. Structured data is for machines. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Note:

Computers have one job: processing data. Unfortunately, the content we write is often difficult for computers to understand.

In the same way we might review our grammar for the sake of our readers, we can help computers understand what we're writing about.
