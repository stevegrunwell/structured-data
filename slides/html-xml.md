##  HTML + XML

* HyperText and eXtensible Markup Language
* Meant to convey information in a meaningful way <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="0" -->

		<body>
			<h1>Document Title</h1>
			<p>This is paragraph text</p>

			<ol>
				<li>List item 1</li>
				<li>List item 2</li>
			</ol>
		</body>
	<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="0" -->

Note:

The first type of structured data I want to talk about is HTML, which is literally designed to structure data.

XML, meanwhile, is a way to structure data to make it easier for machines to process, while still being somewhat readable by humans.

Unfortunately, HTML doesn't give us a way to hint at what type of content the document represents.
