## Schema.org

* Structured data standard with broad vocabulary <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* Supported by Google, Microsoft, Yahoo!, and Yandex <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* Developed in the open <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Note:

Finally, the major search engines came together and decided the best path forward was an open standard: Schema.org.
