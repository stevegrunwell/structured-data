### Microformats & Dublin Core

* Competing standards for rich data (events, people, media, etc.)
* Dublin Core is a specific set of standards, but designed to be limited in scope <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* Microformats includes hCalendar, hCard, and more. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Note:

Microformats and Dublin Core both popped up as a way to better contextualize content.

Dublin Core trends more academic, but isn't explicitly limited to markup.

Microformats try to make the addition of structured data as we write content as easy as possible, giving us ways to differentiate between things like people, places, and events.
