### RSS

* An extension of XML for content syndication
* Designate post titles, content, dates, etc. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* Standardized and can be validated <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Note:

Fast-forward a bit, and we land on Really Simple Syndication, or RSS.

Used to syndicate content between sites, but is mostly used for surfacing new content (e.g. latest posts)
