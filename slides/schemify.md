### Shameless Plug: Schemify

* WordPress plugin to automatically inject JSON-LD objects <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* Filters to handle custom post types and meta <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> [wordpress.org/plugins/schemify](https://wordpress.org/plugins/schemify/)

Note:

If you're running a WordPress site, introducing structured data is pretty easy.

Popular plugins like Yoast SEO and The Events Calendar will already inject a fair amount, but for everything else there's Schemify.
