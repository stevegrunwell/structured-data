### Google's Knowledge Graph

* <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Enhanced results from structured data
* <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> **search** engine => **answer** engine

Note:

One of the biggest benefits of implementing structured data in your content is Google's Knowledge Graph.

Google is moving beyond pointing people to answers, and instead trying to answer the user's question. It's able to do this thanks to structured data, to literally build a graph of information around the web and how it all relates.
