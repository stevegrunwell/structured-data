> Never forget, the content you write is for humans, not machines.

Note:

I've mentioned this before, but it's worth saying it again: the content we write is for humans, not machines.

Machines get smarter all the time, and will eventually be able to understand what we write the way a human could. Structured data helps them out, but it's ultimately people we want to read our content.
